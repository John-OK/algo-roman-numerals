# 1. Write a method TO_ROMAN, TO_ROMAN takes in INPUT_NUMBER (an arabic number)
# 2. Create a OUTPUT string, set to ''
# 3. Create a ROMAN_NUMERAL_TO_ARABIC_MAP that includes roman numerals as keys, 
#    arabic numbers as values
# 4. Iterate over ROMAN_NUMERAL_TO_ARABIC_MAP, keep track of ROMAN_NUMERAL and 
#    ARABIC_NUMBER
# 5. Set EVENLY_DIVISIBLE_TIMES = INPUT_NUMBER / ARABIC_NUMBER:
# 6. If EVENLY_DIVISIBLE_TIMES >= 1
# 6a. Append ROMAN_NUMERAL to OUTPUT EVENLY_DIVISIBLE_TIMES
# 6b. Subtract ARABIC_NUMBER from INPUT_NUMBER EVENLY_DIVISIBLE_TIMES
# 7. Return OUTPUT
